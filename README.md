This is the master repository for all my KSP plugins and supporting infrastructure, 
including MonoDevelop solution file and utility scripts.

All plugins are included as git submodules, so if you clone, do it with `git clone --recursive`, 
and otherwise follow the good practices described in this comprehensive article: [Mastering Git Submodules](https://medium.com/@porteneuve/mastering-git-submodules-34c65e940407)
